Plant Disease Prediction using CNN

So here we will look at Plant Disease Prediction using CNN
Then we will create a web app where we can upload a new image and our model will tell us what disease does the plant have. 

If you want to replicate this model on your local machine please do not rename any files because if you do it wont work. 

Here in the trained_model inside app folder you will upload the h5 model that you will save from your notebook once you are done building your model in google colab. 
Right now cant upload the model cause the file is huge (250mb)
